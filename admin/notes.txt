the following code is the same but the top one is much simpler 
<?= $row['name'] ?>
<?php echo $row['name'] ?> 

/// upload fiel in php

steps : 
  1- make the upload dir called uploads
  2- make the upload var refering to the upload dir path 
  3- check th file uploaded correctlly without any error 
        if (isset($_FILES['file']) && $_FILES['file']['error'] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) ;
  4- we need the temp_name and the new of the file
       $tmp_name = $_FILES['file']['tmp_name'];
       $name = $_FILES['file']['name']; //the name here should the same in the form   
       
  5- move the uploaded file to the location
         if (move_uploaded_file($tmp_name, $uploads_dir . $name)) 




<?php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] == 'POST') {
    $uploads_dir = './uploads/'; // Specify the directory to which you want to upload the files
    // Check if the file was uploaded without errors
    if (isset($_FILES['file']) && $_FILES['file']['error'] == UPLOAD_ERR_OK) {
        $tmp_name = $_FILES['file']['tmp_name'];
        $name = $_FILES['file']['name'];
        
        // Move the uploaded file to the desired location
        if (move_uploaded_file($tmp_name, $uploads_dir . $name)) {
            echo 'File uploaded successfully.';
            echo "globals"."<>";
            var_dump($GLOBALS)  ;
        } else {
            echo 'Error uploading file.';
        }
    } else {
        echo 'File upload error.';
    }
}
?>

    <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
